Working with S3 GeoTIFF Data
============================

Stratus supports GeoTIFF data stored in S3. It is recommended you use `cloud optimized GeoTIFFs <https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/CloudOptimizedGeoTIFF>`_ when storing GeoTIFF data in S3.

This data can be loaded and published through GeoServer. For more information on adding a store and publishing layers, please see the `GeoServer documentation for S3 GeoTIFF <../../geoserver/community/s3-geotiff/index.html>`_.
