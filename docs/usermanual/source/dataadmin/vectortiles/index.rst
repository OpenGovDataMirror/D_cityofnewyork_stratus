Using the vector tiles output format
====================================

Stratus supports "vector tile" output by default in addition to the more standard image tile output. While the standard WMS output will generate a georeferenced map image, a vector tile contains georeferenced vector data, clipped into tiles for easy retrieval.

.. note:: This is an output format, not a data source.
