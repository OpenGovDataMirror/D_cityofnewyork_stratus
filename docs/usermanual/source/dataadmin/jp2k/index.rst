Working with JPEG 2000 (JP2K) data
==================================

Stratus supports data saved in `JPEG 2000 <https://jpeg.org/jpeg2000/index.html>`_ format. This image format utilizes wavelet compression for more efficient storage.

This data can be loaded and published through GeoServer.

For more information on adding a store and publishing layers, please see the `GeoServer documentation for JPEG 2000 <../../geoserver/extensions/jp2k/>`_.

Caveats
-------

JPEG 2000 support is also available through the :ref:`GDAL formats extension <dataadmin.gdal>`.

The GDAL version of JPEG 2000 has better performance from the standard (Java-based) extension.
