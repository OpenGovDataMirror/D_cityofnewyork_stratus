How to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
==================================================

The Same Origin Policy enforced by browsers is designed to prevent a malicious script from one server being able to access sensitive data on a different server.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is enabled by default on Stratus.

For a detailed reference on CORS, refer to the `W3C Technical Report for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing <https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/>`_.
